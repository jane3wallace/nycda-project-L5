# NYCDA WD Lesson 5: <i>JavaScript</i>
A project that I created during my New York Code + Design Academy Web Dev 100 class in Philly after Week 3 Lecture 1. This project was to help familiarize yourself with JavaScript and its syntax.

### Assignment:
* Create a "cheat sheet" JavaScript file that contains working examples with comments of:

  * Variables

  * Debugging (alerts, comments, the console)

  * Different data types

  * Arrays

  * Objects

  * Testing

  * Logic

  * Functions

  * For loops

  * While loops

  Your cheatsheet should be in a JavaScript (.js) file and linked to a Web page that successfully executes all the code in the cheatsheet without errors. As you work on it, feel free to comment out parts of the cheatsheet to focus on just the code you are working on for each concept.

* Write 3 different functions that take input and return something via the console or an alert
